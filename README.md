# [google-book-search](https://mighty-basin-71904.herokuapp.com/)

In this repository, I have built a Books Search application that queries the Google API database. A user can search for their favorite book, view that book title in the Google Book store online, and compile a list of saved books that they enjoy. Once they have been read, a user can simply delete the book from their list.

<h1>Overview:</h1>
The overall goal of this application was to utilize the full MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node). I utilized a React Front-End to start the application and all of it's boiler plate code. In order to connect all of the pieces together, I had to start compiling my components and think about what the user would interact with once in the application. The React lifecylce methods assisted with the querying and displaying portions of a user search. Node, Express, and MongoDB helped save a book and ultimately purchase it later.

<h1>Technologies Used:</h1>
<li>MongoDB - (https://www.mongodb.com/)</li>
<li>Bootstrap - (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/)</li>
<li>React - (https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)</li>
<li>Node JS - (https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)</li>
<li>Express - (https://expressjs.com/en/guide/error-handling.html)</li>

<h1>Setup Before Deployment:</h1>
<li>Clone the repository on your local device and open Terminal or Bash</li>
<li>In Terminal or Bash, the user will run the following command to download all application dependencies: "npm install"</li>
<li>In Terminal or Bash, the user will run the following command to run the application: "npm run start"</li>
<li>Once the command is run, a successful message will appear "App running on http://localhost:3000"</li>
<li>In your browser, type "http://localhost:3000/"</li>

<h1>Future Development:</h1>
If I were to develop this application further, I would focus on enhancing the customer experience. This would include alerting the user when they "saved" a book and adding in a "purchase" functionality directly in-app. I would also reconfigure the book display details so that book length, rating, and suggested book titles render upon user search.
